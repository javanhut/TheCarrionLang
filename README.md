# The Carrion Programming Language 

### The Carrion programming language is a python like programming language written in Go. It is meant to be a fun project. it's interpreted and dynamically typed 


## Notes:
Currently the language is in development.

## Fun things I'm doing to the language.
2 types of increments are accepted the c style: i++
and the python style: 
i += 1
notation. 
It has similar syntax to python but no typing just yet will have optional type hint eventually.
